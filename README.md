<b>Binance P2P Best Price</b>

Binance P2P Best Price is a Chrome extension designed to help traders and users identify the best P2P offers on Binance automatically. It filters offers based on amount ranges, advertiser reputation, and price thresholds, providing visual and audio cues when a target offer is found.

🚀 Key Features
1. Smart Filtering & Highlighting
The extension analyzes the P2P table in real-time and highlights rows based on your configuration:

Range Matching: Checks if the advertiser's limit (Min-Max) overlaps with your desired transaction amount.

Advertiser Quality Check: Only highlights offers from advertisers with ≥95% completion rate and ≥300 orders.

Price Thresholds: Automatically detects if an offer is below your specified Max Price.

2. Visual Indicators (Color Coding)
🟢 Green Background: The offer matches your requested Amount range AND the advertiser meets quality standards.

🔶 Orange Price Tag: The price is equal to or lower than your configured Max Price.

🏆 Gold Outline (VIP): A special gold border appears around the advertiser's stats if they are a "VIP" merchant (≥97% completion & ≥450 orders).

Bold 100%: Emphasizes advertisers with a perfect completion record.

3. Audio & Visual Alerts
Never miss a price drop while multitasking:

🔊 Sound Alert: Plays a "ding" sound when a price matching your criteria is found.

⚡ Tab Flashing: The browser tab title blinks (e.g., 🔥Page 1: 39.50) to grab attention.

🚨 Favicon Alert: The tab icon creates a flashing alert animation.

Blinking UI: The price cell itself blinks orange to guide your eye immediately.

4. Automation & Data Persistence
Auto-Pagination: If the user is idle (no mouse/keyboard activity for >15s), the extension automatically checks subsequent pages (up to a configured limit) and reloads to keep data fresh.

Price Logging:

Calculates the average price based on the lowest 35% of offers.
